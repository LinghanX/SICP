### The book that everybody is talking about

I have long heard that SICP is ‘perhaps the best book ever written’. Yet seems like not many people has thoroughly read it. A quick search online about the solutions and notes about this book is scarce and frustrating. Therefore since I am starting my masters degree in Computer Science, I might as well take this chance to see if this book is indeed great. 

The goal of this repository is to keep track of the notes and exercises. Hopefully I will find it useful in the future.
